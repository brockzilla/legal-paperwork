# Executing a Will in St. Charles County, Missouri

Note: I'm not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. It's just an outline of the steps I took when appointed the executor of a will in 2017.

- Find a lawyer who deals with estate/probate administration (you need one in Missouri if the estate is greater than 40k)
- Get several copies of the Death Certificate (where?)
- Round up important documents (will, deeds, titles, financial statements, etc)
- Meet with lawyer, give them copy of will and death certificate, plus dates of birth and SSN for each beneficiary from will (and your own SSN)
- File application to probate the will and ask that you're appointed as the executor
- They'll give you sealed papers and give you 30 days to file a statement of accounts
- Get an EIN for the trust
- Take the sealed papers, will, and death certificate to bank
- Transfer everything into a new account for the estate, which you can use to pay bills, etc.
- Check deeds/titles to look for other names
- Once everything has been rounded up, file a statement of accounts
- Publish a note in a legal paper, then wait 6 months
- File something else with court describing plan for distribution, then wait another month
- Divvy everything up
- File taxes for the applicable years
- Close the estate account
